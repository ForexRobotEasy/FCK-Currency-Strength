# FCK Currency Strength Indicator

This code is a currency strength indicator for the MetaTrader 5 trading platform. It calculates the relative strength of various currencies using a proprietary algorithm. The indicator takes into account recent performance and overall market trends to provide real-time updates on currency strength. It also displays the information in an easy-to-understand format and allows traders to navigate through features with a user-friendly interface.

## User-defined variables

- `CurrencyStrength[]`: An array to store currency strength values.
- `LastUpdateTime`: The last update time of currency strength.
- `IsFirstRun`: A flag to check if it's the first run.

## Initialization function

The `OnInit` function initializes necessary variables and performs any required initialization tasks. It resizes the `CurrencyStrength` array based on the number of symbols, sets the initial value of `LastUpdateTime` to the current time, and performs any other necessary initialization code.

## Start function

The `OnStart` function is the main function of the indicator. It calculates the currency strength, updates it every minute, and performs any required trading functions, user interface actions, and logical conclusions.

## Calculate currency strength function

The `CalculateCurrencyStrength` function is responsible for calculating the currency strength values. It clears the `CurrencyStrength` array, performs necessary calculations, and updates the currency strength values for each currency symbol.

## Custom functions

The code provides a placeholder for adding any necessary custom functions for trading and user interface purposes.

## Deinitialization function

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the indicator is being deinitialized. It performs any necessary deinitialization tasks and cleanup.
